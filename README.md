# Automated-Attendence-System-Using-Face-Recognition


The main purpose of this project is to build a face recognition-based attendance system for educational institution to enhance and upgrade the current attendance System into more efficient and effective as compared to before. The current old system has a Lot of ambiguity that caused inaccurate and inefficient of attendance taking. Many problems Arise when the authority is unable to enforce the regulation that exist in the old system. Thus , by means of technology, this project will resolve the flaws existed in the current system. while Bringing attendance taking to a whole new level by automating most of the tasks. The technology working behind will be the face recognition system. The human face is One of the natural traits that can uniquely identify an individual. Therefore, it is used to trace Identity as the possibilities for a face to deviate or being duplicated is low
